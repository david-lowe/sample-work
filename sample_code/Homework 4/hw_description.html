<h1>Homework 4</h1>
Due 2016-09-27 at the start of lecture.<br><br>

<ol>
  <li>Study Chapters 16-18 of <a href="../linux-commandline.pdf">Shotts</a>.</li>
  <li>Study Chapters 6, 9, &amp; 19 of Jones, Maillardet, &amp; Robinson.</li>

  <li> Write an executable R script called "random-normals" which generates X
normally distributed random numbers with mean M and standard deviation V using
the Box-Muller transformation, where X, M, and V are supplied as command line
arguments.  In an R script named "plot-normals.R", source your "random-normals"
file and use its code to generate 1,000 standard normal random deviates and
produce one figure in a file called "box-muller.pdf" containing the following:
<ul> <li>A kernel density estimate of your normally distributed random numbers.
(Hint: use the "plot" function on the object produced by the "density" function
in R.),</li> <li>The theoretical density (in red) of the distribution from
which your normally distributed random numbers are drawn.</li> </ul> </li>

  <li>Write an executable R script named "combn" that takes two command line
arguments: N &amp; K, where both are integers and 1 &le; K &le; N.  Display a
helpful message when the script is invoked with inappropriate arguments.  Write
to standard output all possible combinations of the elements of {1,...,N} taken
K at a time as follows. Randomize the order in which the combinations are
displayed and, for each combination, randomize the order of the K elements.
Your code should display exactly 'choose(N,K)' lines, with each line containing
only K elements separated by a space.  No superfluous output should be
displayed.  Hint: Generating all the combinations (in a non-random order) is
easily accomplished with a builtin function in R.</li>

  <li> <i>This part of the project will give you experience implementing Monte
Carlo power calculations.</i> Download the <a href="../l07/urn.R">urn.R</a> file for
our recent lecture.  Add code at the bottom to answer the following:  1. If the
level of significance is 0.05, what is the rejection region for this problem?
2. If the true proportion of black balls is 0.6, what is the power of the test
for the null hypothesis that the proportion of black balls is 0.5, versus the
one-side alternative that the proportion is greater than 0.5?  3. What is the
power if the true proportion is 0.7?  In answering these questions, be sure to
assess the Monte Carlo error.</li>

  <li> Using the hit-and-miss method, find the area defined by the region
{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 &le; 0.5, x^2 &le; y &le; x }.  As always, assess your Monte
Carlo error.  Submit your solution in a file named "area.R"</li>

  <li> Using Monte Carlo integration, find the integral of the function f(x) =
1-2/pi*(1-x)^2*exp(x)/x*asin(sqrt(x)) for x in [0,1].  Be more creative that
simply sampling from the uniform distribution.  As always, assess your Monte
Carlo error.  Submit your solution in a file named "integral.R"</li>

  <li>Consider the usual introductory statistics formula for a 100(1-alpha)%
confidence interval on the population mean assuming that the population is
normally distributed and that the population standard deviation is not known.
Write a function named 'sample.size' that returns the sample size that should
be used such that there is probability 'p' that the width of a 100(1-alpha)%
confidence interval is (no more than) 'width' when the actual (but unknown)
standard deviation is 1.  Your calculation should use Monte Carlo methods based
on 'nSamples' replications.  The function signature should be:<br>

<span class="mono">sample.size &lt;- function(p,width,alpha,nSamples)</span><br>

Now, still use the same formula, but suppose the population can be
exponentially distributed with rate 1.  Modify your function to take another
argument 'dist' which equals either 'normal' or 'exponential' to accommodate
both cases.  Only submit your second function in a file named
"sample-size.R".</li>

  <li>Submit this homework by committing the necessary files (including any
data files) in the appropriate directory and pushing to your central Git
repository.  Remember to not commit files that are easily reproducible.</li>
