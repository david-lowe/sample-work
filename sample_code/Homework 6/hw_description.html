<h1>Homework 6</h1>
Due 2016-10-11 at the start of lecture.<br><br>

<ol>
  <li>Study Chapters 27-29 of <a href="../linux-commandline.pdf">Shotts</a>.</li>
  <li>Study Chapter 10 &amp; 12 of Jones, Maillardet, &amp; Robinson.</li>

  <li>Design and execute a simulation study to investigate the performance of
the paired t-test and the paired permutation test.  Investigate: (i) the size
of the test under the null hypothesis that there is no difference and the
power under several alternative values for the mean difference, (ii) several
sample sizes, and (iii) the case when the data is normally distributed and the
case when the data is highly skewed (e.g., a Beta(0.1,1) shifted
by some value).  Use parallel computing facilities in R to speed up your
simulation study.  Since our server is a shared resource, limit your code to
four cores.  Save your R code in a file called 'simulation.R'.  Write a memo in
a LaTeX file 'memo.tex' that describes your design, execution, and results of
the simulation study to be read by your statistician boss.</li>

  <li>Recall that the script 'root-finding.R' from a previous lecture sourced
two files --- named 'secant.R' and 'bisection.R' --- to define the 'secant' and
'bisection' functions.  Provide your own implementation of these functions
using the same filenames.  Make your code as efficient as possible, evaluating
the supplied function as few times as possible.  Also, make your functions
general so they will work with other inputs than those used in the
examples.</li>

  <li>In a previous homework assignment, you wrote a function 'sample.size'
that calculated the number of observations needed to obtain a confidence
interval with desirable properties.  The naive approach was this: (i) run a
little simulation study when the sample size was 'n', (ii) check to see if the
intervals have the desired properties, and (iii) increment 'n' and repeating
the previous steps until the intervals have the desired properties.  Rewrite
your 'sample.size' function to use a computationally efficient root-finding
algorithm that you implemented for the previous problem.  Name your script
'sample-size.R'.  State in an R comment which algorithm you are using and
why.</li>

  <li>Submit this homework by committing the necessary files (including any
data files) in the appropriate directory and pushing to your central Git
repository.  Remember to not commit files that are easily reproducible.</li>
