<h1>Homework 8</h1>
Due 2016-11-03 at the start of lecture.<br><br>

<ol>
  <li>Study Chapters 34-36 of <a href="../linux-commandline.pdf">Shotts</a>.  Congratulations!  You finished the book.</li>

  <!-- <li>Study Chapters 12 of Jones, Maillardet, &amp; Robinson.</li> -->

  <li><b>The Sine Model Version of the Bivariate Von Mises Distribution:</b>

  Consider the sine model of the von Mises distribution described in Section 2.2 of a <a href="http://dahl.byu.edu/papers/lennox-dahl-vannucci-tsai-2009.pdf">paper</a>.
  (You will need to read all of Section 2 to understand the notation.)
  Write a function named 'dvonmises' with signature 'function(x,mu,nu,kappa1,kappa2,lambda,log=FALSE,use.normalizing.constant=TRUE)' which evaluates the density (or, if 'log=TRUE', the natural logarithm of the density) of the
  sine model of the bivariate von Mises distribution for the supplied parameters at the angle pair given by x.  In the case of 'use.normalizing.constant=FALSE', the result is given without the normalizing constant.  Notice that the normalizing constant involves infinite sums,
  something that the computer cannot do.  The computer can, however, approximate the infinite sum with a finite sum.  Your implementation should seek to find a solution that balances numerical accuracy, efficiency, and speed.  Put your function in a script named 'dvonmises.R'.  Your script should have no other code.

  </li>

<li><b>Implementing the Rejection Sampler:</b>

  Your task is to implement the function for rejection sampling in the script <a href="../l15/rejection-sampler-template.R">rejection-sampler.R</a>.  Do not change anything in this file except the <em>body</em>
  of the function.  Your function should be <em>completely generic</em> (e.g., do <em>not</em> assume that it will be used to sample from any particular distribution, such as a beta or von Mises distribution).  Please be sure to test your function (but do <i>not</i> submit your testing code).

  </li>

<li><b>Using Rejection Sampler for the Bivariate Von Mises Distribution:</b>

  Using your code from the previous parts, write a function named 'rvonmises' with signature 'function(n,mu,nu,kappa1,kappa2,lambda)' which generates 'n' independent and identically distributed
  realizations of the sine model von Mises distribution for the supplied parameters.  The result of the function should be an 'n' by 2 matrix.  Insights into the implementation are given in the second
  paragraph in Section 4.2 of the paper, which references <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118538397/PDFSTART">Mardia, et. al. (2007)</a> and that paper's
  <a href="http://www.biometrics.tibs.org/datasets/060139_supp_materials.pdf">appendix</a>.   See, in particular, Theorem 3 of the appendix.
  (You should have access to the paper when within the University network and the appendix from anywhere.)  Put your function in a script named 'rvonmises.R'.  Again, your script should have no code other than the function definition.

  </li>

<li><b>Contour plots for the Bivariate Von Mises Distribution:</b>

  Write an R function named 'show.vonmises' with signature 'function(n,mu,nu,kappa1,kappa2,lambda,show.contours=TRUE)' which uses the previous parts to plot contours of the specified sine model density as well as 'n' realizations
  from that distribution.  Note that plotting the contours can be disabled if 'show.contours=FALSE'.  Likewise, if 'n' can be zero, no realizations are displayed.  Explore many different combinations of parameter settings to convince yourself that your code is correct.

  </li>

<li><b>Checking Your Code:</b>

  You can get check your code by comparing your results against those produced by code in the <a href="../examples/vonmises-demo">'vonmises-demo' directory</a>.

  </li>

  <li>Submit this homework by committing the requested files in the appropriate directory and pushing to your central Git repository.</li>
