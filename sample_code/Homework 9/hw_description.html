<h1>Homework 9</h1>
Due 2016-11-10 at the start of lecture.<br><br>

<ol>

  <li><b>Poisson Regression, Round II:</b>  Implement the function described in <a href="poisson-regression.R">poisson-regression.R</a>.  Do not change the script name.</li>

  <li><b>Simulation Study for Poisson Regression:</b>
Consider the poisson regression in the previous problem.  Your task now is to
conduct a simulation study in a script named "simulation.R" that explores the
long run relative-frequency performance of the following estmators for beta:
<ul>
<li>Maximum likelihood estimator</li>
<li>Bayes estimator under squared-error loss where the prior distribution on beta is a normal distribution with mean 0.4 and variance of 0.2^2.</li>
<li>Bayes estimator under 0-1 loss where the prior distribution on beta is uniform on -5 to 5.</li>
</ul>

Specifically, you are to estimate the bias and mean squared error (MSE) of the
estimators of beta when the true value of beta varies from 0 to 0.8 in
increments of 0.05 for fixed data x_1, ..., x_n being 0.91, 2.34, 2.54, 1.57,
1.63, 1.08, 0.30, 0.90, 0.08, 2.01, 1.5, 1.2.  In one plot, produce a
publication-ready PDF file named "mse.pdf" showing the MSE vs. beta for each of
the three estimators.  Do the same for the bias and name it "bias.pdf".  Write
a summary of your findings in a file "memo.tex" that gives your high-level
conclusions from this simulation study, including the two figures that your
produced.

  </li>

  <li>Submit this homework by committing the necessary files in the appropriate
directory and pushing to your central Git repository.  Remember to not commit
files that are easily reproducible.</li>
