A professor who teachs classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays at BYU wants the dates
of every lecture for a given semester.  Write an executable R script named
'lecture-days' that writes to standard output only the Tuesdays and Thursdays
between two dates (inclusive) passed as command line arguments in the format
YYYY-MM-DD.  Additional command line arguments are optional and give dates that
should be excluded from the list.  For example, Fall 2016 at BYU is from Sept.
29, 2016 to Dec. 8, 2016, inclusive, but Nov. 22 (a Friday instruction day) and
Nov. 24 (Thanksgiving) are not lecture days.  In this case, the professor would
use the following command:

./lecture-days 2016-09-29 2016-12-08 2016-11-22 2016-11-24

Display each day on its own line and use, for example, the formatting such that
Oct. 29, 2016 is displayed as 2016-09-29.

A few notes: If insufficient arguments are passed, display a helpful message.
You do *not* need to verify that each command line argument is a valid date.
You may use the internet but cannot post to a forum.  For full credit, use
vector operations instead of explicit loops.  You may find the 'as.Date'
function helpful.
